I am a Masters student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).
My current research involves removing disfluencies implicitly in speech translation, and incorporating segmentation decisions into training. I am currently advised by Alex Waibel, and have been lucky to visit [KIT](http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/) in recent summers.

Generally, I am interested in speech translation, low-resource language processing, and multilingual NLP.

Previously, I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Human Language Technology group from 2012-2017, primarily on machine translation and language learning applications.
I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2012, where I studied Math and Linguistics.
My undergraduate [thesis](http://linguistics.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/honors/past-honors-theses) compared unsupervised segmentation methods on a set of unrelated languages with Ann Irvine.

When not at my terminal, I like to [learn languages](https://www.duolingo.com/esalesky), run long distances, and bike to ice cream.
