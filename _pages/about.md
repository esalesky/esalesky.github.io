I am a PhD student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/).
Generally, I am interested in speech translation, segmentation, low-resource language processing, and multilingual NLP.

Previously I was a Masters student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by Alex Waibel, and often worked with Alan Black and the lab at [KIT](http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/), which I was lucky to visit in summers. 
My research focused on different aspects of speech and text translation, including phoneme-informed models, learning segmentations online, and disfluency removal ([new dataset here!](https://github.com/isl-mt/fluent-fisher)).

Before grad school, I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Human Language Technology group from 2012-2017, primarily on machine translation and language learning applications.
I graduated from Dartmouth College in 2012, where I studied Math and Linguistics.
My undergraduate [thesis](http://linguistics.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/honors/past-honors-theses) compared unsupervised segmentation methods on a set of unrelated languages with Ann Irvine.

When not at my computer, I like to [learn languages](https://www.duolingo.com/esalesky), run long distances, and bike to ice cream.
